# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves comprehensive bug detection and analysis for a horse racing prediction system. The system includes PDF data extraction, race data analysis, prediction algorithms, database management, and various utility components. The primary goal is to systematically identify existing bugs, syntax errors, logic issues, and potential runtime problems throughout the codebase to ensure system reliability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the keiba prediction system, I want to identify all syntax errors and import issues in the codebase, so that I can understand what needs to be fixed before the system can run properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Python files are analyzed THEN the system SHALL identify all syntax errors and report their locations
2. WHEN import statements are checked THEN the system SHALL detect missing modules and circular import issues
3. WHEN function calls are examined THEN the system SHALL identify undefined functions and incorrect parameter usage
4. WHEN variable usage is analyzed THEN the system SHALL detect undefined variables and scope issues

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify logic errors and potential runtime issues in the code, so that I can prevent crashes and unexpected behavior during execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN file operations are analyzed THEN the system SHALL identify missing file existence checks and potential path issues
2. WHEN exception handling is reviewed THEN the system SHALL detect unhandled exceptions and bare except clauses
3. WHEN data type usage is examined THEN the system SHALL identify potential type mismatches and conversion errors
4. WHEN loop and conditional logic is analyzed THEN the system SHALL detect infinite loops and unreachable code

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify data handling issues and potential security vulnerabilities in the codebase, so that I can ensure safe and reliable data processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database operations are analyzed THEN the system SHALL identify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities and connection issues
2. WHEN file I/O operations are reviewed THEN the system SHALL detect unsafe file operations and missing validation
3. WHEN data parsing is examined THEN the system SHALL identify missing error handling for malformed data
4. WHEN external API calls are analyzed THEN the system SHALL detect missing timeout handling and error responses

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify code quality issues and anti-patterns that could lead to bugs, so that I can improve code maintainability and reduce future errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN functions are analyzed THEN the system SHALL identify overly complex functions and missing return statements
2. WHEN variable usage is reviewed THEN the system SHALL detect unused variables and shadowed names
3. WHEN code structure is examined THEN the system SHALL identify duplicated code and inconsistent patterns
4. WHEN dependencies are analyzed THEN the system SHALL detect unused imports and missing requirements

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify performance bottlenecks and resource management issues in the code, so that I can prevent system slowdowns and resource exhaustion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loops and iterations are analyzed THEN the system SHALL identify inefficient algorithms and nested loops
2. WHEN memory usage is reviewed THEN the system SHALL detect potential memory leaks and excessive object creation
3. WHEN file operations are examined THEN the system SHALL identify missing file closure and resource cleanup
4. WHEN database queries are analyzed THEN the system SHALL detect inefficient queries and missing connection management

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create a comprehensive bug report with prioritized issues and recommended fixes, so that I can systematically address all identified problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN bugs are identified THEN the system SHALL categorize them by severity (critical, high, medium, low)
2. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a detailed report with file locations and line numbers
3. WHEN fixes are recommended THEN the system SHALL suggest specific code changes and best practices
4. WHEN the report is generated THEN it SHALL include a summary of total issues found and their impact assessment
